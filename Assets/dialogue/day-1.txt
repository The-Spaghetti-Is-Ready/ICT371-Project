Hello, I will be your carer for the next few days.
My job is to aid you with your daily activites and see you through the day.
You can check your daily activities by opening your journal (Reach the book with your right controller and press the side button to grab it).
Tasks will require you to search for objects around the house or play a mini-game. (You can interact with objects with the side button or trigger; feel free to experiment).
Once an activity is completed, it will show up with a checkmark next to it on the diary entry.
These tasks should help keep your brain active and improve your overall wellbeing.
Please be sure to complete all tasks for today. I will be here if you need any further assistance.
